# Differentiable Solvers

*Differentiate all the things.*

From the [NLSolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl) readme:
```
The NLsolve package solves systems of nonlinear equations. Formally, if F is a multivalued function, then this package looks for some vector x that satisfies F(x)=0 to some accuracy.
```
In the context of differentiable programming, $F$ might have an auxiliary parameter $\alpha$, so ones solves the equation
$$
    F(x;\,\alpha) = 0
$$
for the parameter $x$. Changing the value of $\alpha$ and then solving for $x$ again one will usually get changing solutions $x^*$.  Under [some regularity conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem) this implicit dependence can be made explicit by a smooth function 
$\alpha \mapsto x^*(\alpha)$.

The derivative $\frac{dx^*}{d\alpha}$ of this map is found via implicit differentiation, starting from the property of $x^*$ being a solution and differentation both sides w.r.t. $\alpha$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
    0 
    &= \frac{d F(x^*,\,\alpha)}{d\alpha}\\
    &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial x^*}\frac{dx^*}{d\alpha} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial \alpha}\\
    \iff\\
    \frac{dx^*}{d\alpha} &= 
    \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x^*}\right)^{-1}
    \frac{\partial F}{\partial \alpha}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now to use this result within a larger program within Reverse mode AD, we only need to evaluate vector Jacobian products (VJP) of the form $w^\top \frac{dx^*}{d\alpha}$, which simplifies:
$$
w^\top\frac{dx^*}{d\alpha} = 
\left(w^\top \left(\frac{dF}{d\alpha}\right)^{-1}\right) \frac{\partial F}{\partial \alpha}
$$
Rather than computing a full Jacobian $\frac{dF}{d\alpha}$ and inverting it explicitly, we can thus solve a linear system against $w$. With iterative methods such as GMRES we can do this by only accessing the inner Jacobian via matrix-free VJPs $w^\top\frac{dF}{d\alpha}$. The obtained solution $u$ is then used in a final VJP, leading to the following two-phase procedure
$$
\begin{aligned}
    u&=w^\top \left(\frac{dF}{d\alpha}\right)^{-1}\\
    w^\top\frac{dx^*}{d\alpha}
    &= u^\top \frac{dF}{d\alpha}
\end{aligned}
$$
In pseudo-code:
```julia
# TODO vjp notation is too sketchy, fix later

function xstar(α)
    x = NLSolve(x -> F(x, α))
    function vjp(w)
        u = LinSolve(v -> vjp(α -> F(xstar) , α, -w))
        return vjp(α -> F(xstar), α, u)
    end
    return x, vjp
end


```
